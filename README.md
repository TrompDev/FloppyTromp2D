# 🕊️ FloppyTromp: The Political Flight 🏛️💥

Welcome to **FloppyTromp**, the absurdly addictive game where politics meets chaos, and you're just one flap away from getting *rekt*. Can you dodge the flying scandals, survive the partisan bullets, and unlock a roster of your favorite (or least favorite) political figures? 🤔

## What is this?

FloppyTromp is a satirical, *Flappy Bird*-style game for degens who love a good political meme. Whether you're dodging scandals or literal bullets, your goal is simple: **Don’t crash.** But the more you play, the deeper into the absurd rabbit hole you go...

## How to play?
1. **Flap** 🦅: Tap, tap, tap to avoid obstacles that may or may not be political in nature. (No promises.)
2. **Dodge Bullets** 💣: In Bullet Mode, everything gets real fast. Dodge faster than a politician avoiding tough questions.
3. **Unlock Characters**: Friends or foes, Democrats or Republicans—you’ll unlock a wild cast as you soar (or plummet) through levels.
4. **Power-Ups** 🚀: Level the playing field with ridiculous power-ups like the "Filibuster Shield" or "Liberal Tears Jetpack."

## Why you need this game in your life:

- **Floppy** gameplay with an unpredictable twist: you're dodging political obstacles in an endless meme-fest.
- **Unlockable characters** from all sides of the aisle. Whether you're flying with Republicans or Democrats, the game keeps you guessing.
- **Bullet Mode**: Just when you thought you were safe, here comes the bullets. Dodge and survive, or get meme’d to oblivion.
- **Power-ups** that make absolutely no sense but make everything better.
- **Memes**. Lots of them.

## Features:

- 💥 *Flappy Bird Chaos*: You know the drill. Tap to stay in the air and avoid everything trying to take you down.
- 🔫 *Bullet Mode*: Things get intense. Can you flap your way out of this mess?
- 🗳️ *Unlock Political Icons*: Republicans, Democrats, and maybe even the occasional wild card (looking at you, Libertarians).
- 💡 *Power-ups*: Because who doesn’t want to blast through scandals with a power-up?


This game is satire. No real-life politicians were harmed in the making (we think). If you're offended by flying elephants, donkeys, or bullets... you might be taking this game too seriously. 😉
